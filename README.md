# NumberGame
This is a rock jumping maze based off a common puzzle game. It consists of trying to find a valid path for a chess piece
under certain constraints.

You are given a board with weights from 1 to any number that validly fits on the board. The piece is placed somewhere on
the board, and a goal tile has its weight set to 0. The rook moves only vertically and horizontally. It moves by a number
of tiles determined by the weight of the tile it is on.

The purpose of the assigment was to gain experience working with Java GUI's. Back end code was provided and changes were
made to MazePanel and MazeDriver. Specific learning outcomes include practice with JFrame, JPanels, JButtons, as well as dialog boxes.
